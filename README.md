<h2> Hi, I'm Rafael Escaleira!</h2>

<p><em>Computer Enginner at <a href="https://www.facom.ufms.br">Federal University of Mato Grosso do Sul</a></br>Sr. iOS Developer at <a href="https://apps.apple.com/br/app/cartola-oficial/id1129547202">Cartola</a></br>
</em></p>

As a seasoned iOS Developer with six years of experience, I bring a wealth of expertise in crafting top-notch mobile applications. My forte lies in writing clean and efficient code, leveraging cutting-edge design patterns, and embracing test-driven development practices.

Throughout my career, I've had the privilege of contributing to challenging projects across diverse sectors, ranging from finance to sports. I've collaborated with renowned companies such as Banco Next, Letsbank, and even worked on the Cartola project with Rede Globo. Additionally, I've developed the "Budget" app, available on the Apple Store, which stands out not only for its functionality but also for its visually stunning layout.

I'm a strong advocate for collaboration and knowledge sharing, as evidenced by my public projects on GitHub, where I actively engage with and learn from the developer community.

I'm always on the lookout for new challenges and opportunities to expand my skills and make meaningful contributions to the ongoing advancement of technology. I'm open to connecting with professionals and companies that value innovation and technical excellence, ready to explore potential collaborations and synergies in future projects.
