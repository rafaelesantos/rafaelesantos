<p><em>Computer Enginner at <a href="https://www.facom.ufms.br">Federal University of Mato Grosso do Sul</a></br>iOS Developer at <a href="https://www.capgemini.com">Capgemini</a></br></br>
</em></p>
<p>I started my studies in Android and iOS development before starting computer engineering college. During my course, I made several open-source projects published on Github to contribute to the mobile community. In addition, I did volunteer work at the UFMS academic computer athletic association, where I developed an application for both platforms. Also, I worked on an ERP application to computerize the production of beef cattle</br></br></p>
